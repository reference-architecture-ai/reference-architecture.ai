# Introduction 

There are tools for advanced analytics, including free ones from Google and Kaggle.

There are well known and validated deployment architectures for applications and the cloud.

Yet the number of practical applications is still tiny, and they retained niche implementations.

Letâ€™s bridge the gap in knowledge between science and engineering to make fast, efficient and practical AI deployments.
