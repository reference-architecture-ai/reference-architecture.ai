# The challenge 

The medical profession put a lot of effort into collaboration, starting from Latin as a common language to industry-wide thesauruses like [UMLS](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/index.html). Yet if full of scandals where publication in the prestigious journal would be retracted and the World Health Organisation would change its policy advice based on the article. I think "paper claiming that eating a bat-like Pokémon sparked the spread of COVID-19" takes a prize. One would say that editors in those journals don't do their job, and while it may seem true, I would say they had no chance: with a number of publications about COVID (SARS-V) passing 300+ per day, we need better tools to navigate via such flow of information.
 
When I am exploring topics on science or engineering, I look at the diversity of the opinion, not the variety of the same cluster of words, same thought. I want to avoid confirmation bias. I want to find articles relevant to the same concept, not necessarily the ones which have similar words. My focus is to build a natural language processing pipeline, capable of handling a large number of documents and concepts, incorporating System 1 AI (fast, intuitive reasoning) and System 2 (high-level reasoning) and then present knowledge in a modern VR/AR visualisation. Search or rather information exploration should be spatial preferably in VR (memory palace, see Theatre of Giulio Camillo). A force-directed graph is a path towards it, where visuals are assisted by text — relevant text pops up on the connection and where people explore the concepts and then dig deeper into text. The purpose of the pipeline that knowledge should be re-usable and shareable.
